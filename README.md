# Mega Moji - Discord Emoji Downloader

A Discord bot with a web interface that downloads all emojis from a Discord server and packages them into a zip file.

## Features

- 🎨 Download all emojis from any Discord server the bot is in
- 🌐 Simple web interface to select the server

- 🖼️ Supports both static and animated emojis

## Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" and give it a name
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Click "Add Bot"
5. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable:
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent (if needed)
6. Copy the bot token

### 2. Invite Bot to Server

Use this URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's Client ID):
```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot
```

Make sure the bot has access to the servers you want to download emojis from.

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your bot token:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_actual_bot_token_here
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Railway Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. A [Railway](https://railway.app/) account
2. A GitHub account (or use Railway CLI)
3. Your Discord bot token ready

### Deploying to Railway

#### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create a new Railway project**
   - Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In your Railway project, go to the "Variables" tab
   - Add the following environment variable:
     - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token

4. **Deploy**
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python project
   - It will install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - The app will start using the `Procfile`

5. **Get your URL**
   - Railway will assign a public URL (e.g., `https://mega-moji.up.railway.app`)
   - You can also set a custom domain in the project settings

#### Option 2: Deploy using Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Railway project**
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

4. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Railway-Specific Notes

- Railway automatically provides a `PORT` environment variable - the app uses this automatically
- The `Procfile` tells Railway how to start your application
- `runtime.txt` specifies the Python version (Railway will use this)
- Your bot will be publicly accessible at the Railway URL
- Railway will automatically redeploy when you push to your connected GitHub branch

### Troubleshooting

**Python version installation errors:**
- If you encounter `mise ERROR failed to install core:python@3.11.x`, try:
  1. Update `runtime.txt` to use a more recent patch version (e.g., `python-3.11.9`)
  2. Alternatively, remove `runtime.txt` and let Railway auto-detect the Python version
  3. Clear the build cache in Railway dashboard: Settings → Clear Build Cache → Redeploy

**Bot not connecting / Server not showing in dropdown:**
1. **Check Railway logs** - Go to your Railway project → Deployments → View logs
   - Look for messages like "✅ Bot has logged in to Discord!"
   - Look for errors like "ERROR: Discord login failed - invalid token"
   - Check if you see "Bot is in X server(s)" message

2. **Verify environment variable** - In Railway dashboard:
   - Go to your project → Variables tab
   - Ensure `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly (no extra spaces, correct token)
   - The token should be a long string starting with something like `MTxxxxxxxxxx...`

3. **Check bot status** - Visit: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/status`
   - This will show: `bot_exists`, `bot_ready`, `token_set`, `guild_count`
   - If `token_set` is false, the token isn't configured
   - If `bot_ready` is false, check Railway logs for connection errors

4. **Verify bot is in server**:
   - Double-check the bot is actually added to your Discord server
   - The bot needs to be a member of the server to list it

5. **Check Discord Developer Portal**:
   - Verify the bot token hasn't been regenerated (if regenerated, update Railway)
   - Make sure "Server Members Intent" is enabled in Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents

### Monitoring

- View logs in the Railway dashboard under your service
- Check the "Metrics" tab for resource usage
- Railway provides automatic HTTPS and custom domains

## Notes

- The bot must be a member of the server you want to download emojis from
- Emoji files are saved with their original names and formats
- Animated emojis are saved as `.gif` files
- Static emojis are saved as `.png` files
- When deployed, the web interface will be accessible via your Railway URL
